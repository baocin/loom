Loom is a privacy-focused, local-first system for memory augmentation and personal analytics. It automatically captures and contextualizes your digital life, helping you remember important moments, track patterns, and gain insights from your daily activities.

## Overview

Born from experiences with tools like Roam, Obsidian, Logseq, and Notion, Loom goes beyond traditional note-taking to capture both information and its surrounding context. Whether it's documenting important conversations, tracking health habits, or providing legal protection, Loom serves as your personal memory system.

### Real-World Applications

- **Legal Protection**: Automatic detection and transcription of important encounters
- **Time Management**: Smart reminders based on context (e.g., parking meter tracking)
- **Health Tracking**: Pattern recognition in daily habits and routines
- **Meeting Documentation**: Automated capture of conversation context and key points

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack (V2)
- **Frontend/Backend**: Rust with Tauri for cross-platform support
- **Database**: DuckDB with vector extensions for efficient data storage and retrieval
- **Architecture**: Local-first design prioritizing privacy and performance

### Key Features

- **Automated Context Capture**
  - Real-time audio event detection and classification
  - Location tracking with privacy controls
  - Device metrics monitoring (accelerometer, battery usage, etc.)
  - Continuous audio transcription for important moments
  
- **Smart Processing**
  - Edge device computation for privacy
  - Pattern recognition across multiple data sources
  - Contextual awareness for relevant notifications
  - Historical data analysis for insights

## Getting Started
(wip)
1. Install [bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Clone
4. `bun install`
5. `cd src-tauri` and `bun run tauri dev` (desktop app)

## Privacy & Security

Loom is designed with privacy as a core principle:
- All data processing happens locally on your device
